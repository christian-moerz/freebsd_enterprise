## What is FreeBSD? 

[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) has been making computing better for three
decades, through:

* Open source and open governance
* Security by design
* Permissive license to support innovation
* Performant in a wide diversity of uses
* Stability and predictability across releases

## What is The FreeBSD Foundation?

[The FreeBSD Foundation](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/) is a US based
501(c)(3) non-profit organization located near University of Colorado, Boulder.

It supports the development, security, operations, and successful use of
FreeBSD. Foundation staff are deeply connected with the global FreeBSD 
development and user community, helping ensure the project’s vitality. 

## The Background Story

This Working Group began because a long-time FreeBSD user, Michael Osipov, took
the time to provide the Foundation with detailed notes on where he is hitting
limits with FreeBSD. 

The next step was to gauge interest – Greg Wallace at the FreeBSD Foundation
posted a call for interest on LinkedIn and on Discord and the response was
great. 40 people raised their hands to join the Working Group.

The Workgroup consists of a variety of stakeholders, ranging from Enterprise
users, consultants, vendors to hobbyists to regular FreeBSD users.
