Beginning of 2023, Greg Wallace at the FreeBSD Foundation gauged interest in the
formation of an Enterprise Working Group via posts to different 
[social media channels](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gtewallace_enterprise-freebsd-opensource-activity-7084607866363359234-YMZx/).

August 2023 he founded the Enterprise Working Group out of initial feedback and
inputs from Enterprise users, which identified gaps and potential improvements.

The initial founding meeting set the stage for the work areas of the group.

### Mission of the Enterprise Working Group

Bring clarity to feature and other gaps that limit enterprise adoption of
FreeBSD as a general-purpose server platform and provide a supportive group to
help developers close these gaps.

### Scope of the Enterprise Working Group

For the remainder of 2023, the Work Group will focus on the set of features
identified initially and refined during the Work Group’s first meetings. The 
Work Group will also concern itself with onboarding a semi-permanent group of
developers and users to look after the ongoing utility of FreeBSD for general
purpose enterprise server workloads

### Success Metrics

* Staffed development plans for high priority projects
* Steady to growing number of WG participants who perform a growing diversity
  of tasks, to include things like advocacy (e.g. DevRel)
* Feature updates in priority projects
* Greater utility by current enterprise users
* Increased adoption of FreeBSD as a general purpose enterprise server platform
* More support for FreeBSD by “critical” enterprise tech & resources, such as
  XDR vendors, CIS benchmarks

### Deliverables

* Improved satisfaction among enterprise users
* Documentation of WG progress and deployment/use best practices
* Community growth
* Growing support for FreeBSD by critical enterprise tech vendors
