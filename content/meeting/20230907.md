I have the Wrike projects set up for some of the projects and will add the others over the next day.

If you are not called out as a volunteer in the notes document above, please add a comment with your name in the project you can help with and say if you can help as a user/tester or as a developer.

I will also be sending out another poll to find a good day/time for the next meeting the first week in Oct.

Would be great if we can make progress on OCI, Samba and maybe one or two others over the next few weeks.

Thanks again!

Greg
