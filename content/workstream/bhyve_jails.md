title: "Bhyve and jails management tooling"
draft: false
---

Within this group and out of the original feedback, one work stream emerged for
specifying and building a "definitive bhyve+jail management toolset" to be added
to FreeBSD base.

The main pain points mentioned in initial communications:
* High manual effort required to get jails running
* Lack of resources in maintaining ports providing utilities (i.e. run by one
  person) and some of them even not maintained and developed further at all
* Insufficient oversight and management of needs and requirements, lack of
  progress
* Low visibility and insufficient marketing of available technology options to
  enterprise customers

## Updates

* 05 Oct 2023: presentation of Enterprise Work Group and BHYVE/jail work stream
  at the weekly bhyve developers/users call
* 04 Oct 2023: Chris Moerz onboarded as project lead
