* Cloud native / K8s: Important to future of FreeBSD to have an OCI runtime 
* AD/DNS integration: This is non-existent. In a large environment it is 
  impossible to email the DNS admin about every single change, therefore Active
  Directory makes heavy use of dynamic DNS updates authenticated via GSS-TSIG
  (requires Kerberos)
* Nvidia / GPU support: Zoran at Supermicro indicated that they have the ability
  to do tests, but they lack some Nvidia GPU drivers
